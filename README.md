Welcome, this is a Read Me Document. I am not sure if we need to have this for documentation but I initialized the repository with it just in case.

To get a local repository that you can edit,

1. this is a test
2. this is also a test

`void functioncall()`

``` c#
// Hello1.cs
public class Hello1
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
   }
}
```

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
